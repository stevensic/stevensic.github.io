   This page contains many apps that I have written with in my time in the Talen Devlopment Program. I had previsouly worked on different websites on code.org. Code.org gives you opporutnites to create your own website. During my time I worked on a group collab project and made a website, dedicated to Marvel (MCU). Also I personally made a website about my own country Cape Verde! These experience gave me good insight about coding and fun, awarding it can be.
