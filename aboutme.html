    Hi my name is Steven as you know. I just wanna use this opporunity to create many websites and impact on others. I am a first generation student and want to make my family proud that is my main goal, while at URI. I want to have a postive impact on my younger brother and show him a good role model to look up to. Im from pawtucket, Rhode Island. I grew up rhode island for all my years. Making a change of pawtucket, to kingston is a huge differnce. I also went to tolman high school for all 4 years!
